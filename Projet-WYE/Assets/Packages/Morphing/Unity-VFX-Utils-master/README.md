## Point Cache Sub-Graphs

In the *PointCache* folder you can find various sub-graphs to sample and modify point cache positions via nodes insted of using the *Set Position from Map* block. 

## Additional Credits

The *PointCacheUV* node is recreated from a node tree by *Remy_Unity* (he worked at Unity Technologies by the time he wrote the post) posted as screenshot in the [Unity Forums](https://forum.unity.com/threads/procedural-generation-of-a-point-cache-for-vfx-graph.659254/#post-4416136).
