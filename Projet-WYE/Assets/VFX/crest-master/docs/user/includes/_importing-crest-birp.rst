Import *Crest* assets by either:

-  Currently we do not prepare release packages.
   However, we do tag each asset store version, so the zip corresponding to each version can be downloaded by clicking the desired version on the :link:`Releases page <GitHubLink/releases>`.
-  Getting latest by either cloning this repository or :link:`downloading it as a zip <GitHubLink/archive/master.zip>`, and copying the *Crest/Assets/Crest/Crest* folder into your project.
   Be sure to always copy the .meta files.

.. note::

   The *Crest/Assets/Crest/Development* folder is only used to develop *Crest* and should be skipped.
