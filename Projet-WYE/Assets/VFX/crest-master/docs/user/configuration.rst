Configuration
=============

Some quick start pointers for changing the ocean look and behaviour:

-  Ocean surface appearance: The active ocean material is displayed below the *OceanRenderer* component.
   The material parameters are described in section :ref:`material_parameters`.
   Turn off unnecessary features to maximize performance.

-  Animated waves / ocean shape: Configured on the *ShapeFFT* script by providing an *Ocean Wave Spectrum* asset.
   This asset has an equalizer-style interface for tweaking different scales of waves, and also has some parametric wave spectra from the literature for comparison. See section :ref:`wave-conditions-section`.

-  Shallow water: Any ocean seabed geometry needs set up to register it with *Crest*.
   See section :ref:`shallows`.

-  Ocean foam: Configured on the *OceanRenderer* script by providing a *Sim Settings Foam* asset.

-  Underwater: If the camera needs to go underwater, the underwater effect must be configured.
   See section :ref:`underwater` for instructions.

-  Dynamic wave simulation: Simulates dynamic effects like object-water interaction.
   Configured on the *OceanRenderer* script by providing a *Sim Settings Wave* asset, described in section :ref:`dynamic_waves_settings`.

-  A big strength of *Crest* is that you can add whatever contributions you like into the system.
   You could add your own shape or deposit foam onto the surface where desired.
   Inputs are generally tagged with the *Register* scripts and examples can be found in the example content scenes.

All settings can be changed at run-time and live authored.
When tweaking ocean shape it can be useful to freeze time (from script, set *Time.timeScale* to 0) to clearly see the effect of each octave of waves.

Reflections contribute hugely to the appearance of the ocean.
The look of the ocean will dramatically changed based on the reflection environment.

The Index of Refraction setting controls how much reflection contributes for different view angles.

Refractions
^^^^^^^^^^^

Refractions sample from the camera's colour texture.
Anything rendered in the transparent pass or higher will not be included in refractions.

See :ref:`transparent-object-before-ocean-surface` for issues with Crest and other refractive materials.


.. _orthographic_projection:

Orthographic Projection
-----------------------

Crest supports orthographic projection out-of-the-box, but it might require some configuration to get a desired appearance.

Crest uses the camera's position for the LOD system which can be awkward for orthographic which uses the size property on the camera.
Use the *Viewpoint* property on the *Ocean Renderer* to override the camera's
position.

Underwater effects do *not* currently support orthographic projection.


.. _ocean_construction_parameters:

Ocean Construction Parameters
-----------------------------

There are a small number of parameters that control the construction of the ocean shape and geometry:

-  **Lod Data Resolution** - the resolution of the various ocean LOD data including displacement textures, foam data, dynamic wave sims, etc.
   Sets the 'detail' present in the ocean - larger values give more detail at increased run-time expense.

-  **Geometry Down Sample Factor** - geometry density - a value of 2 will generate one vert per 2x2 LOD data texels.
   A value of 1 means a vert is generated for every LOD data texel.
   Larger values give lower fidelity surface shape with higher performance.

-  **Lod Count** - the number of levels of detail / scales of ocean geometry to generate. The horizontal range of the ocean surface doubles for each added LOD, while GPU processing time increases linearly.
   It can be useful to select the ocean in the scene view while running in editor to inspect where LODs are present.

-  **Max Scale** - the ocean is scaled horizontally with viewer height, to keep the meshing suitable for elevated viewpoints.
   This sets the maximum the ocean will be scaled if set to a positive value.

-  **Min Scale** - this clamps the scale from below, to prevent the ocean scaling down to 0 when the camera approaches the sea level.
   Low values give lots of detail, but will limit the horizontal extents of the ocean detail.


.. _advanced_ocean_renderer_options:

Advanced Ocean Parameters
-------------------------

These parameters are found on the *Ocean Renderer* under the *Advanced* heading.

-  **Surface Self-Intersection Mode** - How Crest should handle self-intersections of the ocean surface caused by choppy waves which can cause a flipped underwater effect.
   When not using the portals/volumes, this fix is only applied when within 2 metres of the ocean surface.
   *Automatic* will disable the fix if portals/volumes are used and is the recommended setting.

-  **Underwater Cull Limit** - Proportion of visibility below which ocean will be culled underwater.
   The larger the number, the closer to the camera the ocean tiles will be culled.
